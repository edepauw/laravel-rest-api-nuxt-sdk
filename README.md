## ‚ú® Features

-   üì¶ Resource-based client
-   üîê Built-in token handling via cookies
-   ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable base API URL and token cookie name
-   üåç Works seamlessly with Nuxt 3 and TypeScript

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install lomkit-rest-client
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

to use the Lomkit REST client, you need to configure it in your Nuxt 3 application. You can do this by creating a plugin file in your `plugins` directory.

```typescript
// plugins/restClient.ts
export default defineNuxtPlugin(() => {
	const lomkitRestClient = useNuxtApp().$lomkitRestClient;
	lomkitRestClient.addApiClient({
		slug: "default",
		url: "https://localhost",
		requestInit: () => {
			const access_token = useCookie("cookie");
			return {
				headers: {
					Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token.value}`,
				},
				credentials: "include",
			};
		},
	});
});
```

explanation:

-   `slug`: A unique identifier for the API client.
-   `url`: The base URL of your Lomkit REST API.
-   `requestInit`: A function that returns an object containing the request headers and credentials. In this case, it retrieves the access token from a cookie named `cookie` and includes it in the `Authorization` header.
-   `credentials`: Set to `include` to include cookies in cross-origin requests.

you can add multiple API clients with different configurations by calling `addApiClient` multiple times with different `slug` values.

# üìö useResource

The `useResource` composable is the main entry point for interacting with the Lomkit REST API. It allows you to create a resource client that can perform various operations on a specific resource.

The `useResource<T>(resourceName, resourceConfig?)` composable returns an object with methods to interact with a specific resource via the Lomkit REST API. See the [methods](#methods) section for more details.

```ts
const preset = {
	search: {
		includes: [
			{
				relation: "category",
			},
			{
				relation: "stars",
			},
		],
		limit: 12,
	},
};

const productsResource = useResource<IProducts>("products", preset);

//you can also destructure the result to get the methods directly
const { mutate, findOne, search } = useResource<IProducts>("products", preset);
```

## <a id="methods"></a> üß© Methods

### üîé `search(request?)`

Search for resources based on the request parameters. (See [Search](https://laravel-rest-api.lomkit.com/endpoints/search) for more details.)

```TypeScript
const res = await productsResource.search({
    filters: [{
        field: "name",
        name: "Product Name",
    }],
    includes: [
        {
            relation: "category",
        }
    ]
}).catch((err) => console.error("Error during search: " ,err));

//pagination methods
const products = ref(res);
const handleNextPage = () => {
    products.value = await products.nextPage();
};

```

### üîé `findOne(request?)`

Returns the first matching resource. (See [Search](https://laravel-rest-api.lomkit.com/endpoints/search) for more details.)

```TypeScript
const product = await productsResource.findOne({

        name: "Product Name",
    }],

```TypeScript
const details = await productsResource.details();
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è `mutate(mutations)`

Mutate a resource with the provided mutations. (See [Mutate](https://laravel-rest-api.lomkit.com/endpoints/mutate) for more details.)

```TypeScript
const response = await productsResource.mutate([
        {
            operation: "update",
            key: 2,
            relations: {
                star: {
                    operation: "attach",
